# Winns-open

(Winns)[https://winns.no/no] is company delivering environmental friendly heating systems. This involves the design of systems for Sensor Fusion.

In this repo, Winns provide open APIs for a number of open data-resources.

* subset: the small subset of data-formats (here supported) are those which are ready for production. 

Hence, if you are in need of other data-formats, then please contact [Erik Morset](mailto:erik@winns.nosubject=[GitHub]%20RequestSource%20New%20Winns-API-functions),


##  API

* IWMAC: before running the "test-iwmac.py", remember to contact (IWMAC)[www.iwmac.no]; for the best possible support, we suggest taking contact with [the expert](mailto:jostein.markussen@iwmac.no).
* NordPool: now under development; the new API address key deficiencies in publicly available Nordpool interfaces.
